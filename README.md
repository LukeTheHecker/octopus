# Octopus Neurofeedback

The Octupus Neurofeedback is coded in Python 3 using PyQt5 and uses signals from the brain vision actiCHamp [Remote Data Access](https://pressrelease.brainproducts.com/real-time-eeg/) functionality.

This program is used for reading EEG data and plotting/ processing it. This can be used as a basic for neurofeedback only if ~100 ms of delay (caused by RDA) is acceptable.
