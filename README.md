# Octopus Neurofeedback

The Octupus Neurofeedback is coded in Python 3 using PyQt5 and uses signals from the brain vision actiCHamp [Remote Data Access](https://pressrelease.brainproducts.com/real-time-eeg/) functionality.

This program is used for reading EEG data and plotting/ processing it. This can be used as a basis for neurofeedback only if 50-100 ms of delay (caused by RDA) is acceptable (go [here](https://pressrelease.brainproducts.com/real-time-eeg/) for an explanation).

# Intended Use
If you are using an EEG amplifier by Brain Products and would like to set up a live data analysis, visualization or neurofeedback paradigm then this repository may help you as an entry point. However, I want to disclose that some programming knowledge in python is necessary to customize the code to meet your needs. 

## Get started

* Install [Anaconda/Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) 2 or 3
* create environment using requirements.txt:  
`conda create --name octo --file requirements.txt`
* Activate the environment: `conda activate octo`
* Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/LukeTheHecker/octopus.git` or download the [ZIP file](https://github.com/LukeTheHecker/octopus/archive/master.zip).
* go to the cloned directory using `cd octopus`
* Execute the `main.py` from your conda environment:

```
conda activate octo
python main.py
```
